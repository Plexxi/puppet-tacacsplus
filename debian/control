Description: Puppet module for TACACS+ PAM/NSS
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 The tacacsplus module manages TACACS+ PAM and NSS settings.
